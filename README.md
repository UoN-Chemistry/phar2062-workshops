# phar2062-workshops

This repository holds the folders and tutor-supplied files for the PHAR2062 module.

Once downloaded, the script "setup.sh" should be run. This will install two helper commands for the user:

* `phar2062_restore` "cleans" the current folder, restoring tutor-generated 
files to their original state (if accidentally modified by the user). 
User-generated files are not changed or removed.
* `phar2062_update` updates the folders and files structure to the latest 
release, but again does not modify any user-generated files.
